# Online Shop

This is the project that I built to learn GraphQL. I used Django as the backend. I created the frontend using the React. I implemented the GraphQL using Appollo client. I then moved on to create the frontend with the same functionality using Next.js. While creating the frontend with Next.js, I also learnt how to use Tailwindcss.
